# Chesster
Reverse Engineering the Milton Bradley Grand Master Chess Computer and Updated features.

We are going to disassemble the one I have, and recreate the schematic of the original board. Once we have this created it will be easier to maintain other systems as we can create a repair guide.

Then using this information a new controller will be created that will use StockFish or integrate with Chess.com in some way. My goal here will be to play Chess live on Twitch and have the Chat vote on moves that the 
board will then play for them. 

When I do this I will be redesigning the front panel as I dislike the original buttons.
